This project focuses on analyzing bike rider data using Microsoft Excel to derive meaningful insights.
The dataset was cleaned to remove inconsistencies, missing values, and duplicates to ensure accuracy.
Various Excel functions and formulas were applied to structure and refine the data effectively. 
Charts and slicers were integrated to enhance interactivity and allow users to filter and explore data dynamically.
The charts in the dashboard provide insights into bike buyers' demographics based on marital status and education level.
It categorizes buyers as single or married and analyzes their purchasing patterns. 
The visualization also highlights the impact of education levels, such as high school, bachelor's, or master's, on bike-buying decisions. 
Trends in buyer preferences are displayed using bar charts and pie charts, making it easy to identify key customer segments.
These insights help businesses target the right audience and optimize marketing strategies.
